# Restaurant2

This is an online menu for a restaurant. For this project, I wanted the people using the website to be able to order food online.

This project includes a media query (at min width 815px).
In mobile the size, there is a sticky menu that can be used to quickly navigate to one of the sections of food.
There is also a javascript function that populates and displays an array of items picked from the page.

To run this project, open the order.html file in the order folder in a browser.
